%  Equation of the equinoxes, compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions but
%  using the truncated nutation model IAU 2000B.
%
%  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
%  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
%
%  Status:  support function.
%
%  Given:
%     date1,date2      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
%
%  Returned (function value):
%                      equation of the equinoxes (Note 2)
%
%  Notes:
%  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
%     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
%     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
%     among others:
%
%            date1          date2
%
%         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
%         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
%         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
%         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
%
%     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
%     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
%     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
%     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
%     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
%     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
%
%  2) The result, which is in radians, operates in the following sense:
%
%        Greenwich apparent ST = GMST + equation of the equinoxes
%
%  3) The result is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions except
%     that accuracy has been compromised for the sake of speed.  For
%     further details, see McCarthy & Luzum (2001), IERS Conventions
%     2003 and Capitaine et al. (2003).
