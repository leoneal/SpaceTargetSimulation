                    SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURE

INTRODUCTION

A character-coded machine-readable version of the "Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory Star Catalog" (SAO, SAO Staff 1966) was prepared by T. A. Nagy
(1979) from a packed binary tape obtained from the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory.  In addition to certain format modifications, equatorial
coordinates in radians and cross identifications from the Table of
Correspondences SAO/HD/DM/GC (Morin 1973) were added to the converted version;
however, the known errata lists were not incorporated at that time.  This
version of the catalog served as a starting point for the version described
here.  As a prelude to creation of the 1984 version of the SAO, a new version
of the "SAO-HD-GC-DM Cross Index" was prepared (Roman, Warren and Schofield
1983), since most of the changes and extensions for the SAO involve data
presently in the Cross Index.  The original SAO did not use lower case letters,
making some spectral types seem strange.  All capital letters that really
should have been lower case in the spectral types have been changed.  These
changes, which are numerous, are not listed in Table 1.

The 1984 version of the SAO contains the corrected and extended cross
identifications, all errata published up to January 1984 and known to us,
numerous errors forwarded to us by colleagues, and errors discovered at the
Astronomical Data Center during the course of this work.  Recently, Clayton A.
Smith of the U.S.  Naval Observatory, volunteered to provide J2000.0 positions
and proper motions for the SAO stars.  These data have been added to the end of
each record, the positions in both sexigessimal and radian form.  Additional
errors of which we are aware (as of May 1991) have been corrected.

This document describes the current version of the machine-readable SAO
Catalog.  It outlines the procedures used to correct and extend the previous
versions and is intended to enable users to read and process the data without
problems and guesswork.  The following section describes the analysis and
methods used to cross identify the stars and to add component identifications
for stars where more than one SAO record has the same Durchmusterung (DM)
identification.  Section 2 provides detailed descriptions of the catalog format
and codes used in the data records, while Section 3 contains information on the
characteristics of the magnetic tape file.  Miscellaneous remarks and sources
for the corrections incorporated into each version and in this version are
given in Section 4, which also contains bibliographical references.  A sample
listing of data records exactly as they are recorded in the machine-readable
form comprises Section 5. A copy of this document should accompany any
machine-readable version of the SAO Catalog, originating from any one of the
International Network of Astronomical Data Centers.

PROCEDURE

The assignment of components to SAO stars for which more than one entry has the
same DM number was done when preparing the 1983 SAO-HD-GC-DM Cross Index.
That procedure is described in Roman et al. (1983). A somewhat less detailed
description is given here for completeness.

Components were assigned according to the Index Catalogue of Visual Double Stars

                                     1 - 1

(IDS, Jeffers et al. 1963; Worley 1980); for stars not in the IDS, components
were labeled according to visual magnitude.  Supplemental (footnoted) BD stars
(Warren and Kress 1980) were identified and entered with lower case letters.
Corrections and additions to cross-identification data were made as necessary.
Some duplicate DM numbers actually referred to the same star for which SAO data
had been obtained from different source catalogs.  In these cases, one record
has been marked "D" in byte 7, normally the one whose position was judged to be
of lower accuracy.  However, all data have been retained so that a different
choice may be made by the user.  Many stars occur in two DM catalogs (CD, CPD)
in the southern hemisphere.  The SAO gives numbers from different catalogs for
the components of some double stars; hence, although there are no duplicate DM
numbers, component confusion can occur.  Although a search for such systems was
not exhaustive, the catalog was searched for adjacent entries with declinations
within 3 arcmin of each other.  Most of these entries proved to be double stars
and were appended with letter designations as if their DM numbers had been the
same.  These DM numbers were not changed.

An important subset of rather bright stars in the published SAO Catalog has no
DM numbers given. (Most of the stars in this subset were identified as FK3
double stars which were omitted from the FK4.) Many of these had been identified
by W. L. Stein, who supplied probable DM numbers. The positions for these stars
were compared manually with their positions in the various DM catalogs and many
additional identifications were made.

The Astronomical Data Center (ADC) has recently completed the preparation of
machine-readable versions of the three DM catalogs: the BD, the CD, and the CPD.
Using these versions, Mr. Barry Rappaport compared the positions of the stars in
the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog (SAO) with the positions
of the DM stars whose number had been assigned to each entry. A very lengthy
list of possible assignment errors resulted. Each of these has been checked and
the assignment corrected in those cases in which correction appeared desirable.
In many cases, the assignment in the printed SAO is probably incorrect, but the
evidence was not strong enough to warrant a change. As the Henry Draper
Catalogue numbers (HD) had been derived from the DM numbers, those were also
corrected as necessary.

Although the "Henry Draper Extension" (Cannon 1925-1936) stars from "Harvard
Annals", Volume 100, having DM numbers listed in the original catalog, were
included in the SAO, those listed with AG numbers only (Astronomische
Gesellschaft, zones +50 to +54 degrees, Harvard, Rogers 1892; zones +55 to +59
degrees, Helsingfors-Gotha, Kruger 1890) had not been cross identified and
inserted into the machine version. The "Yale Zone Catalogues" (YZ, Barney et al.
1959a, 1959b), which identify stars by their AG numbers, but also give
corresponding DM numbers, were used to cross identify the AG stars. This was
accomplished by using the magnetic tape versions of the YZ and HD catalogs and
matching the stars by machine. A cross index of Henry Draper Extension stars
from "Harvard Annals", Volume 112 (Cannon and Walton Mayall 1949) and DM numbers
(Bonnet 1978) was used to insert HDE numbers from the final HD volume.

Since the GC (Boss 1937) numbers in the "SAO-HD-GC-DM Cross Index" had been
assigned by comparing with HD numbers in the GC, stars without HD numbers in the

                                     1 - 2

Cross Index were missing GC identifications. The magnetic tape file of the GC
was therefore searched by DM number for all stars having no GC numbers in the
Cross Index. Additional GC numbers were found manually (by position) for the few
remaining stars without DM numbers. Fourteen GC stars were found not to be in
the SAO Catalog. HD numbers in the GC were then compared with their counterparts
in the Cross Index for stars in common, leading to the detection and correction
of a number of additional errors.

The catalog contains a numerical code appended to each HD number. The code
originally followed the convention of the "Strasbourg Catalog of Stellar
Identifications" (CSI, Ochsenbein et al. 1981) which assigned the numbers
1, 2, ... for individual components of multiple systems and the digit 9 if two
contiguous HD stars are included in the entry (the lower HD number is usually
given with code 9). Since the component codes were assigned to CSI entries
without regard to letter designations, and because letter designations have now
been added, the HD code was changed to a consistent indication of major
contamination of the spectral type of the component to which the entry applies
by the spectrum of another star (see Table 2). A visual magnitude difference of
0.3 mag was used as the limit for which contamination was indicated. Although
photographic magnitudes would have been more appropriate, the visual magnitudes
in the SAO appeared to be more consistent.


Many HD numbers were added to the "SAO-HD-GC-DM Cross Index" and subsequently to
the SAO, and quite a few incorrect HD numbers were changed. The SAO already
contained spectral types for many of these stars; those types were compared with
the types in the HD, and discrepancies were corrected only where it seemed
desirable. For stars with new HD numbers and no spectral types in the SAO, the
latter were inserted using the machine version of the HD for the main catalog
and the first extension. Spectral types were read from the charts of the second
extension ("Harvard Annals" 112) and approximately 5000 inserted manually; types
were also inserted for other HD stars for which they were missing in the SAO.
For components of multiple stars, spectral types were added or removed according
to the likelihood that the star contributed to the HD type.

Following completion of the Cross Index, all appropriate cross-identification
data were replaced in the 1984 SAO. Additional corrections involving the SAO
only were then made. In certain cases, SAO positions had been found in error,
but correct positions in the SAO system could not have been derived without a
re-reduction of all the original data. Since this would clearly have been
impracticable, positions were taken from the "Cape Photographic Catalogues" for
1950.0 (CPC). (Errata for the CPCs have been published in the zone catalog for
-80 to -90 degrees (Stoy 1968)). The CPC proper motions were applied to the
positions at epoch to bring them to epoch 1950.0.

In the 1984 version, a total of 12,373 SAO records was corrected or
supplemented with 17,915 individual data changes.  All changes are listed in
the accompanying file of corrections (see Section 4).  Changes in the 1989
version, from the 1984 version, are given in Table 13, and those additional
data changed in the 1990 version are given in Table 15.

As noted in the introduction, Clay Smith provided positions and proper motions
at equinox and epoch J2000.0 and on the system of the FK5.

                           SECTION 2 - FILE CONTENTS


A byte-by-byte description of the contents of the machine-readable SAO Catalog
is given in Table 1. The suggested format specifications apply to FORTRAN
formatted read statements and can be modified depending upon individual
programming and processing requirements. All data fields with primary A-format
specifications are blank for missing data; hence the alternate numerical
specifications used for machine searches will produce zero values. Data are
always present in fields for which primary numerical formats are given, except
where specifically noted.

                       SECTION 3 - FILE CHARACTERISTICS

The information in Table 10 is sufficient for a user to describe the indigenous
characteristics of the machine-readable Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
Star Catalog, Version 1990 to a computer. Not included is information easily
varied from installation to installation, such as block size (physical record
length), blocking factor (number of logical records per physical record), total
number of blocks, tape density, number of tracks, and internal coding (EBCDIC,
ASCII, etc.). These parameters should always be transmitted if secondary copies
of the catalog are supplied to other users or installations.

              SECTION 4 - REMARKS, ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND REFERENCES


As mentioned in Section 1, the individual data corrections, additions and
changes included in the 1984 version of the SAO Catalog number 17,915, with
12,373 records (4.8%) having at least one change.  Since many of the changes
involve corrections to data given in previously published catalogs, it is
important for a user to have access to the individual changes if a discrepancy
is found between this catalog and a previously published one.  For this reason,
we have prepared a complete table of all changes made to the previous version
to produce the 1984 version as well as tables of additional changes in the 1989
and 1990 versions.  The first corrections and changes table was prepared by
comparing the uncorrected file against the new version with a computer program
which compared the data fields one by one and produced a formatted changes
table.  The complete table for the 1984 version is given in the accompanying
file of corrections.  If a data entry is blank in either version, it is blank
for the corresponding item in the table.  The column labeled "S" gives the
source of the change, as defined in Table 11 by its numerical code.  Table 13
lists the changes in the 1989 version and Table 15 lists the changes in the
1990 version.  Table 14 explains the codes for the source of the 1989 changes
and table 16 gives the sources of those corrections in the 1990 version that
did not result from the ADC checking of Mr. Rappaport's suggested changes.

  SAO   Note(s)

  6404  The GC incorrectly identifies this star as BD+76 309;
        GC 11190 is BD+76 309, while this star is +77 309.

  9947  This star is misidentified as BD+70 1162 in the GC, as it is in
        the IDS and ADS (Aitken 1932).  Source 3 corrects the DM number
        to +70 1161, assuming that the double entry for +70 1161
        represents the two components of the double star.  This is not
        the case.  SAO 9949 is a duplicate entry and should be deleted.

 15097  The GC incorrectly lists this star as BD+65 761.  It is
        actually +65 751, while +65 761 is SAO 15120, which does not
        appear in the GC.

 17589  The GC incorrectly identifies this star as BD+68x 936, whereas
        it is actually +69 936.

                                      4-2


 23221  Source 1 incorrectly gives this star as BD+53 568a.  It is
        actually +52 568a.

 SAO    Note(s)

 24753  This star is listed as BD+57 825 in several catalogs.  It is
        not in the proper position for the BD star, however.  There is
        a star at the SAO position on photographs, but it is not in the
        BD.


 29370  These corrections are probably in error.  The BD gives +54 1724
 29372  as being SW of +54 1725 and lists both star as magnitude 7.5.
        The SAO, AGK3 and IDS list the brighter star (delta m = 0.6 mag)
        as SE.  the HD also lists the brighter star as south, but gives
        the same right ascension for both stars.  The IDS identifies the
        brighter star as BD+54 1724, as do the HD and SAO, but the AGK3
        reverses the DM numbers, listing the brighter star as +54 1725.

101858  Sources 2 and 3 suggested changing this stars to BD+17 2945.
        It is part of a triple system of which C, the fainter, more
        distant component, is +17 2945.  SAO 101858 and 101859 appear
        to be the A and B components, respectively, of +17 2946.

238176  The GC is in error.  GC 14513 is CP-54 3795 and is not in the
        HD.  GC 14517 is CP-54 3797, which is HD 91593.

All communications resulting in the changes in Table 13 are unpublished. For
13028, it is apparent that the proper motions are in error but accurate values
are unavailable. In addition to the changes noted in Table 13, R. E. Reaves
pointed out that plus signs were missing in bytes 27 and 60, that minus signs
were occasionally found in byte 61, and that the seconds of arc field for the
declinations sometimes read 60.00. These problems have been corrected.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

We wish to express our appreciation to N. J. Schofield Jr., who worked on an
early phase of the SAO project in connection with the revised "SAO-HD-GC-DM
Cross Index", and to D. Hoffleit, S. F. McLaughlin, R. E. Reaves, P. C.
Schmidtke and W. L. Stein for communicating errors. We also thank the several
people who pointed out additional errors, and T. E. Corbin for checking
data for several stars in other catalogs and Mr. Rappaport for sending
us the extensive list of possible problems in the DM numbers assigned
in the SAO. We also thank those listed in Table 16 on page 4 - 7.

for alerting us to other errors. Especially significant was the work
of T. Lederle (Astronomisches Rechen-Institut, Heidelberg), who analyzed
a large number of cross identifications for Durchmusterung stars, provided
a large list of possible errors, and worked with us to improve the changes,
which were then inserted into the 1989 version.

                                     4 - 8


Finally, the new J2000 version of the catalog owes much to the work of C.A.
Smith (U.S. Naval Observatory), who computed the J2000 positions and proper
motions and added them to the data records.
